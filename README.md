It's a little demo app made for Firefox OS made for the [#CPMX5 Mozilla México Hackaton](http://www.mozilla-mexico.org/2014/06/hackaton-de-firefox-os-en-campus-party-2014/)

If this can be useful for you or if you want to improve it, you can download it or fork it.

This project uses [Skeleton CSS](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/) and [this little fiddle ](http://jsfiddle.net/LzX4s/)(you know who you are)
